## !!! WARNING !!!
This is not allowed in any% speedruns because it removes buttons on the main menu screen which can provide an advantage.

## Installation
* Go to the [releases](https://github.com/MrSlimeDiamond/p2-cleanui/releases)
* Download `pak01_dir.vpk`, put it in a new DLC folder (if you don't have one, make a `portal2_dlc3` folder in `Portal 2/`)
* Download `update.vpk` and put it in `Portal 2/update` 
* Rename the existing `pak01_dir.vpk` to something else
* Rename `update.vpk` to `pak01_dir.vpk`
* Unzip everything in `media` into a directory named `media` in `portal2_dlcX`

## Uninstallation
* Remove the `pak01_dir.vpk` from `portal2_dlcX`
* Remove the `media` directory from `portal2_dlcX`
* Remove `pak01_dir.vpk` from `update`
* Rename the copy you had back to `pak01_dir.vpk` (it's important to do this right, your game will break otherwise!)

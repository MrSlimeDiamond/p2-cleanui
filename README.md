## !!! WARNING !!!
This is not allowed in any% speedruns because it removes buttons on the main menu screen which can provide an advantage.

## Includes
* Dark theme UI's
* Custom menu background (optional)
* Unity's custom chat skin
* D-DIN font

## Installation
* Go to the [releases](https://github.com/MrSlimeDiamond/p2-cleanui/releases)
* Download `pak01_dir.vpk` and `media.zip` from the latest stable release
* Rename your `Portal 2/update` directory to `portal2_dlc3` (rename other DLCs if necessary)
* Create a new DLC (probably `portal2_dlc4`)
* Put `pak01_dir.vpk` in the newly created DLC
* Extract `media.zip` into a `media` directory in that DLC

## Uninstallation
* Remove the `pak01_dir.vpk` from `portal2_dlcX`
* Remove the `media` directory from `portal2_dlcX`
* Remove `pak01_dir.vpk` from `update`
* Rename the copy you had back to `pak01_dir.vpk` (it's important to do this right, your game will break otherwise!)
